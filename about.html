        <p>This is a sample static page written in the markdown language, then generated into html with the help of Flask, Flask-Flatpages, and Frozen-Flask. The Goal of this project is to have a static site generator with a template that covers the basic needs of a webcomic website. I currently use drupal for my webcomic, but felt like it has been too much for my needs. In addition to that I have always felt I needed to hack too much of it for a default webcomic layout. Although I love my site, I decided to give building a static-site generator a try. the Flask-Flatpages and Froozen-Flask extensions for Flask gave me an easy way to start that.</p>
<p>It's kind of a mess right now, but I'm learning. if you're interested head over to the <a href="https://github.com/chipperdoodles/comicr">github page</a> and check out the source code.
The static site generator part of this project is just part 1 of a bigger idea, but is a good starting place and will be completely functional on it's own</p>
