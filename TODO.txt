List of ideas to implement and code to work on

* multiple site management
* add uploading via plain ftp support
* figure out packaging entire app (cx_freeze type things)
* make a good informative project site and images
* look into migration from database to flat files (i.e. wordpress to 3color-press)
* alt-text field for comic images
* make optional per page comment (page.body to show up in template)
* settle on metadata
* settle on url naming scheme

in progress:

* add working atom feed (to do this we must add full datetime instead of date)
* Theming variables and configuration, add custom variables for themes
  such as toggle-able html elements and ability to customize colors
* Improve command line tools newpage creation on a per page type basis

done:

* gallery pagetype/imagetype
* make menuname key into a list
* change menu key in header to dict with name and index key
  (allowing for custom menus and ordering by index)

always:

* Ongoing cleaning up of code, and fixing grammatical and spelling issues
* test, test, test!
* question why i'm not using a database
