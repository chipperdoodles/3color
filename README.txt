About
------

(project name changed from temporary comicr)

3color Press is a flask based application intended to streamline making your own comic based website. It is a static website generator that takes markdown formatted text files and turns them into new pages.

I am new to programming and I'm kind of brute learning python and flask by just working on this project.
The project is under heavy development and features are being added as we work on them, however a vary functional core set of features is included
