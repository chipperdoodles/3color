        <p>This is a sample static page written in the markdown language, then generated into html with the help of Flask, Flask-Flatpages, and Frozen-Flask. The goal of this project is to have a static site generator with a template that covers the basic needs of a webcomic website. I currently use drupal for my webcomic, but felt like it has been too much for my needs. In addition to that I have always felt I needed to hack too much of it for a default webcomic layout. Although I love my site, I decided to give building a static-site generator a try. the Flask-Flatpages and Frozen-Flask extensions for Flask gave me an easy way to start that.</p>
<p>It's kind of a mess right now, but I'm learning. if you're interested head over to the <a href="https://github.com/chipperdoodles/comicr">github page</a> and check out the source code.
The static site generator part of this project is just part 1 of a bigger idea, but is a good starting place and will be completely functional on it's own</p>
<p>Sample comics taken from my personal webcomic site <a href="https://noties.org">noties.org</a></p>
<p>features:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic book pagination (first, back, next, latest) based on which book it belongs to.</li>
<li>different page(or post) types. Books(for comic storylines or just one comic), News(for news updates), Single_Page(for site pages like about, contact, readme)</li>
<li>can automatically display the most recent comic on the front page</li>
<li>a /books/ page that will automatically list the book and their pages</li>
<li>a /news/ page that acts as a feed of news posts. This can also be displayed on the front page</li>
<li>the html/css templates use jinja2 so skinning and theming should be pretty accessible.</li>
<li>builds your entire site into static html files which can be easily hosted from any web hosting service</li>
</ul>
