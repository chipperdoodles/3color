Basics
======

In order to use the early versions of 3color-Press it is very useful to have some
information on hand about general computing with the context of using the command line
and understanding files, folders and directories as well as getting slightly familiar
with Python. This won't be teaching you anything complicated, it's only here to make it
easier if anyone is having trouble figuring out where to start or go and to potentially
cover some very basic troubleshooting issues that might occur.


Getting Nerdy
-------------
Eventually 3color-Press may turn into a self contained app with a visual interface,
but we aren't quite there yet! So we'll need to be famliar with working with computers
at a command line level.


Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^
In this document I'll try to explain some very basic terms and ideas which may come
up elsewhere in the documentation.

To get started let's look at files and folders on your computer. You may be used to
browsing these via a file browser on you computer. (such as finder on OsX and Explorer on windows)
If you are great, I expect most people to be but with the growing abstraction of file
management in the mobile era, one can't be too sure.

Another word used for folder is :term:`directory`, these are words are used interchangably.


Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install 3color-Press you'll have to not be scared of doing a little work in the
command line, it doesn't get more complicated than running a few commands to get
things done. Of course you could always do more but we'll to the basics.

In OsX the default :term:`terminal` is an application in the utilities folder named
Terminal. In windows you can use Command Prompt or Powershell.

This is what you'll be using to run any commands you see show up.

.. note::
   In example commands in the documentation you'll see $ command option.
   You don't have to type the $, it simple represents the user prompt before the
   input field.


File Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration and content creation for 3color-Press is based around editing and
creating text files. While command line file editors do exist, such as vim, emacs, nano.
There are plenty of free editors out there. I use github's atom editor and have even included
command that will open your project folder with atom.

List of file editors to look at:

* atom https://atom.io/
* brackets http://brackets.io/
* sublime text https://www.sublimetext.com/
* text wrangler http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html
* textmate http://macromates.com/
* Notepad++ http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
* Vim
* emacs
* nano

To save you some time I recomend atom as it is free and easy to install and manage.
