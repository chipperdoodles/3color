List of ideas to implement and code to work on

* fix the gosh darn atom feed
* clean up set up and folder initialization
* add uploading via plain ftp support (Is this needed?
* make sftp/fabric optional package
* figure out packaging entire app (cx_freeze type things)
* make a good informative project site and images
* look into migration from database to flat files (i.e. wordpress to 3color-press)
* settle on metadata
* settle on url naming scheme/fix for edge cases
* add port configuration option for sftp publish
* python 3 compatibility
* decide if themes folder should be global or site specific (currently site specific)
* fix numbering for name files (if below 10 add 0 or find a better numbering system)

in progress:

* multiple site management (needs more testing)
* add working atom feed (need to investigate point of url breakage)
* Theming variables and configuration, add custom variables for themes
  such as toggle-able html elements and ability to customize colors
  (mostly there, needs testing)
* Improve command line tools new-page creation on a per page type basis

done:

* alt text field for comic images
* gallery pagetype/imagetype
* make menuname key into a list of tuples
* make optional per page comment (page.body to show up in template)

always:

* Ongoing cleaning up of code, and fixing grammatical and spelling issues
* test, test, test!
* question why i'm not using a database
