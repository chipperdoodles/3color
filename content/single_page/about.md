This is a sample static page written in the markdown language, then generated into html with the help of Flask, Flask-Flatpages, and Flask-Freeze. The Goal of this project is to have a static site generator with a template that covers the basic needs of a webcomic website.

It's kind of a mess right now, but I'm learning. if you're interested head over to the github page and check out the source code.
