List of ideas to implement and code to work on

* Ongoing cleaning up of code, and fixing grammatical and spelling issues
* Theming variables and configuration, add custom variables for themes
  such as toggle-able html elements and ability to customize colors
* add working atom feed (to do this we must add full datetime instead of date)
* Improve command line tools newpage creation on a per page type basis
* add uploading via plain ftp support
* change menu key in header to dict with name and index key
  (allowing for custom menus and ordering by index)
* add images and maybe gifs to docs
