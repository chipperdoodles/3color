3color Press
========================================

Hello! And welcome to the documentation for 3color-Press.
This is currently in progress but I'm looking to provide friendly documentation
accessible for everyone.

If You're a user that is new to nerdy things like python and the command line, go
ahead and check out the New Users section. If you are already familiar with the workings of python
you can glance over the quickstart and dig deeper if you wish. Feedback is always welcome too.
